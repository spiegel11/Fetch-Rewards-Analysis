# Fetch-Rewards-Analysis

Project Description:

The submission for this project will consist of three key components:


Database Diagram:

A visual representation of how I structured the provided raw files into a meaningful database schema. This will illustrate the relationships between tables and provide context for how the data is organized.


Python Notebook:

The notebook will detail the steps taken to extract data from JSON files into structured DataFrames.
It will demonstrate how I identified data quality issues, such as duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies.
Additionally, it will include examples of how I used SQL to answer business-related questions based on the dataset.


Email to Business Stakeholders:

A concise and professional email summarizing the data quality issues I uncovered.
The email will outline next steps, including questions for clarification and proposed actions to resolve the identified issues.
This project demonstrates my ability to structure raw data, conduct detailed data analysis, and effectively communicate findings and solutions to stakeholders.
